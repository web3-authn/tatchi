# Overview

Tatchi’s Web3‑Authn SDK lets you build a wallet experience where private keys never leave a dedicated wallet origin. The app embeds a wallet iframe, and all sensitive operations run there in WASM workers with strict CSP.

What you’ll do next:
- Install the SDK and plugin
- Configure the wallet iframe (wallet origin, service path)
- Register your first passkey and log in
- Send your first transaction with secure confirmation

Next: [Install](./install)
