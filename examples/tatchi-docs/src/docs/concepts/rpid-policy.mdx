# RPID Policy

The WebAuthn `rpId` determines which passkeys are visible and reusable. Choose one of two strategies:

## Wallet‑Scoped Credentials

- `rpId = <wallet domain>` (e.g., `wallet.example.com` or `web3authn.org`)
- Acts like an auth provider; one credential works across apps embedding the wallet
- For cross‑site embedding, enable Related Origin Requests by serving `/.well-known/webauthn` on the wallet origin listing allowed top‑level app origins

## App‑Scoped Credentials

- `rpId = <app base domain>` (e.g., `example.com` or `example.localhost`)
- Works across subdomains of the app
- Easiest when wallet and app share a registrable suffix; Safari top‑level fallback naturally matches the app domain

Configure via `iframeWallet.rpIdOverride`. See details and config snippets in [Wallet‑Scoped vs App‑Scoped](./wallet-scoped-credentials).
