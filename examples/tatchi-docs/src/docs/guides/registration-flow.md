# This page has moved

This guide is now consolidated into the Passkeys guide.

- Read: `Guides → Passkeys (WebAuthn)` at ./passkeys
- Context: registration steps, event handling, and UI notes are under the Register section

Why the change: to keep user how‑to content linear and task‑focused, registration is part of the Passkeys flow.
